# Git and Github User Guide

This user guide is specifically tailored to the suit the needs of those contributing code to this repository. It aims to provides a succinct summary that ommits basic Git commands that you will likley not need for contributing to this project, hence it should not be used as a definitive reference for interacting with GitHub and Git more generally.

## What is GitHub?

In simple terms, GitHub is a code sharing site; it can be tought of a combination of a cloud storage platform and a back-up service for all of your programming needs
(similar to Google Drive). To create a GitHub account, [sign up here](https://github.com/join).

More technically, GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. A repository (or repo) can be thought of like a directory on your local computer; 
it tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a project (like this one) is generally also formed of a local directoryâ€”a directory/folder 
for storing your files on your computer. A Git repository is where these files and changes are tracked on GitHub.

### Cloning this Repository

You can start contributing to a GitHub project either by creating a local repo or cloning an existing repo. Since this document is just intended to help you contribute to this repository, we will only cover on the latter.

So what does 'cloning a repository' means? It equates to making a full copy of ('pulling') all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. At any point, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub
